                    p.lead.mb-5
                        | The technology driving modern video games has brought forth new breakthroughs in real-time graphics, simulation, and artificial intelligence (AI), and has become increasingly common in wide range of entertainment, robotics, and virtual/augmented reality applications. In this course, we will cover the key algorithmic techniques that have enabled this revolution, investigate the trade-offs and limitations inherent in these real-time approaches, and discuss open problems and current trends in the field. Topics discussed will include real-time techniques for: physically-based lighting simulation, artificial intelligence (AI), sound simulation, character animation, and large-scale rendering.

                    p.lead.mb-5
                        | Students will participate in a combination of coding projects, student presentations, and class discussions. Coding projects will involve students writing their own real-time graphics, AI, and simulation code and integrate it into a broader framework. The course will take place in a computer lab, and substantial class time will be devoted to in-class programming. Classes are held in a computer lab, and course work will involve substantial in-class programming time with hands-on exploration of the course material. Additionally, students will be expected to present their projects to others in the class, and to provide substantial feedback and discussion of peer work.
