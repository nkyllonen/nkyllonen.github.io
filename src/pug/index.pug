                                | To dive into what makes a Game Engine a Game Engine, we were first tasked to build a game without one. Instead, we used Processing: a free and open-source, Java-based language that cuts out much of the nitty-gritty nuances and the low-level heavy lifting of traditional graphics programming. The task was to create from scratch a "Balloon Pop" game, customized however we wished. My game is a pong-inspired, 2D, single-player game where the objective is to pop as many good balloons as possible while avoiding as many bad balloons as you can.

                                | Now that we've spent an entire semester discussing different aspects of not only game engines, but also fundamental graphics concepts and techniques, we were set free to explore as we saw fit. Seeing as I'd spent all of my assignments thus far using either the game engine provided to us or a classmate's engine, I wanted to try out Unity. My previous experience with it was dated and I had learned from some of my classmates about this new tool called Shader Graph and I was eager to see what I could do with a full-blown, deployed game engine.

This project is a compilation of too many hours setting up Unity and many of Brackey's Unity tutorials.

                        | Despite being a Computer Scientist, I relish being active and away from my computer. I am a stay-at-home dog mom and love taking River on her daily walks and sprinkling in playtimes during my remote workday.

                        | I love to hike, tent camp, and road trip- and try to bundle all three into summer trips with my dad. This year, I joined a co-ed adult soccer league- getting back into the game after 10 years away from the field. In college, I started indoor rock climbing and am excited to try climbing outdoors one day! I love the mental and physical stimulation of climbing- it's active problem-solving, but on the wall.

                        | Music is a passion I've always had and I love jamming out as I crank through components and pages, singing along to my current favorite album. Occasionally, the jams are so good that I have dance breaks under River's judgemental supervision (and sometimes with her if she's feeling silly).
