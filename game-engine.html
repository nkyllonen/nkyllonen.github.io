                  In this simple game, built in Processing, the player moves the green slider
                  left and right to pop as many colorful balloons as possible and gain the most points.
                  One point is gained for every good colorful balloon, while one point is lost for every
                  evil black balloon that is popped. This score is presented along with the current level
                  in the bottom left corner, as shown in <a href="#hw1-fig1">Figure 1</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As you gain points, you move onto more difficult levels. 
                  Currently, the levels increase one notch for every 10 points 
                  earned. Successive levels increase three of the game 
                  parameters: maximum balloon spawning speed, slider speed, and 
                  the chance a newly spawned balloon will be an evil balloon. 
                  Therefore, for every new level you face, not only are the 
                  balloons harder to pop and more likely to be evil, the slider 
                  is able to travel more quickly. This is the only power-up 
                  currently implemented. These values are adjusted as shown 
                  below (<a href="https://github.com/nkyllonen/8980-balloon-pop/blob/master/pop/pop.pde#L100"> pop.pde lines 100-104</a>).

                  There were quite a few features I had in mind while 
                  developing this game. I added to them as I went, but from the 
                  beginning, I hashed out two feature lists: basic features
                  and more farfetched features. These I placed into my Trello 
                  board, as shown in
                  <a href="#hw1-fig2">Figure 2</a> and <a href="#hw1-fig3">Figure 3</a>.

                <p>
                  The biggest feature I tried to implement for this assignment 
                  was the use of a spatial data structure for collision testing 
                  (my first task within my "Next Steps" features list above). 
                  Despite the goal being to improve performance, after much 
                  thought and much work on implementation, I decided that the 
                  gameplay would not actually improve. Although I still wish to 
                  pursue this feature, other features that are listed above 
                  would've more easily accomplished the task of boosting 
                  gameplay, such as adding some sort of missiles or more 
                  complicated balloon movement.

                <div class="subheading mb-3">Algorithmic Discussion</div>
                <p>
                  In developing this game, I allowed my strong Object-Oriented 
                  Programming (OOP) tendencies to lead my algorithmic and 
                  technical decisions. The strongest example of this is in my 
                  (ideally abstract) Object class, shown below
                  (<a href="https://github.com/nkyllonen/8980-balloon-pop/blob/master/pop/object.pde">object.pde</a>).
                  This is a stubby container class. There is no functionality 
                  and it likely hurts the overall runtime of the game. However, 
                  to myself and other OOP developers, the boost in 
                  understanding and organization seems very much worth it when 
                  handling the code. With containers such as Object and its children,
                  <a href="https://github.com/nkyllonen/8980-balloon-pop/blob/master/pop/balloon.pde">Balloon</a>
                  and <a href="https://github.com/nkyllonen/8980-balloon-pop/blob/master/pop/slider.pde">Slider</a>, larger code bases can be more readable and easier to digest.

                  A computational bottleneck within my program is my 
                  collision testing. Since I am very much aware of the 
                  existence of this bottleneck in a majority of graphics
                  programs, I wanted to put some time into building a spatial 
                  data structure, as mentioned above. My first approach, and 
                  the one which is currently still being used, is a brute force 
                  approach. My game loop checks during every frame for 
                  collisions between the slider and each balloon, shown in the 
                  code snippet below
                  (<a href="https://github.com/nkyllonen/8980-balloon-pop/blob/master/pop/pop.pde#L57">
                    pop.pde lines 57-70</a>).

<code class="Processing" id="hw1-code3">
// if this balloon collides with the slider
if (b.checkCollision(brick)) {        
  if (!b.evil) {
    animations.add(new Animation(b.position.copy(), popFrames));
    score++;
  }
  else {
    animations.add(new Animation(b.position.copy(), hotFrames));
    score--;
  }

                <p>
                  After much thought and spending a good amount of time not 
                  only considering, but also attempting to integrate a spatial 
                  data structure, I decided on a gridding approach which would 
                  essentially mark which balloons overlapped with which bins. 
                  After much work, I was able to accomplish this much. I created
                  a <a href="https://github.com/nkyllonen/8980-balloon-pop/blob/master/pop/grid.pde">
                  Grid</a> which knew about which balloons overlapped with 
                  which GridCells. However, the more I thought about the 
                  complexity, the more I realized that there would not be a 
                  performance benefit over my brute force approach. Both
                  methods required iterating over all of the balloons and for 
                  the grid approach, there would be extra computation once the 
                  grid was built. Because of time constraints and other 
                  responsibilities, I chose not to continue working with
                  this gridding approach and kept my brute force calculations.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If given more time, instead of using ArrayLists that shrink 
                  and grow forever, I would instead use fixed length arrays. ArrayLists, although fun, are not the most efficient because 
                  of their conveniently modifiable length. If a max number
                  of balloons was decided upon and I made sure that popped and 
                  lost balloons were respawned at the bottom of the screen, I 
                  believe there would have been a greater computational 
                  improvement than using a fully implemented gridding system.
                </p>

                <div class="subheading mb-3">Game Engine Analysis</div>
                <p>
                  Although Processing does a good job of being an accessible 
                  "gateway" into graphics, an aspect that would've saved me 
                  time from the beginning would be something akin to my Object 
                  class. Having a pre-built container which knew a bit about
                  how it could be displayed/rendered would've expedited my 
                  first few tasks for this assignment, which was build and 
                  design my Object and Balloon classes.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Another, more advanced addition, which would have nullified my earlier discussions about collision testing, would be some 
                  sort of pre-built collider which understood when it 
                  overlapped with other objects. Either this collider itself 
                  would already contain collision checking code or another 
                  object, a collider manager, would contain the collision 
                  algorithms. The collider manager could then be the
                  one that checks to see if colliders are overlapping. Since 
                  games all require the ability to know if two things are 
                  touching (be it if your mouse click landed in the right place 
                  or if your character's arrow was able to hit the enemy), a 
                  built-in collision system would be incredibly useful for 
                  developing games.

                <p>
                  In my game specifically, the state is stored within the 
                  global variables I declared within my

                  loop are the core of how this game functions. My game loop

                  During the entire game, and therefore during this game loop, 
                  Processing is checking for key press events. These 
                  asynchronously interrupt the game to enter the following 
                  function within
                  <a href="https://github.com/nkyllonen/8980-balloon-pop/blob/master/pop/action.pde#L5">
                  action.pde</a>, lines 5-10. This asynchronous interruption 
                  triggers the slider to check to see if either the left or 
                  right arrow keys have been pressed so that the slider's 
                  position can be adjusted accordingly.

                  The two big "non-moving pieces" are my balloons and 
                  animations ArrayLists. Quite simply, my balloons list 
                  contained all of my balloon objects. My animations list, 
                  however, is more nuanced and was necessary for my last 
                  feature: incorporating animations (i.e. displaying gifs). I 
                  looked to the Processing Tutorial page <a href="https://processing.org/examples/animatedsprite.html">
                  Animated Sprite</a> for code and inspiration.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I started by breaking my gifs into individual frames and 
                  storing them globally (popFrames and hotFrames above). When 
                  an event occurred which would warrant an animation (the slider
                  colliding with a balloon) a new Animation object would be 
                  created at that location and told which frames it needed to 
                  display. Therefore, all I needed to do was keep track of
                  which animations were still active so that I could draw those 
                  frames to the screen. Once all of the frames of that specific 
                  gif had been displayed, I then deleted that Animation object.
                  My animations array is therefore almost identical to my 
                  balloons array: both contained the active Balloons and 
                  Animations so that they could be iterated through and properly
                  rendered.

                    To get things rolling (pun intended), I started off by walking through the classic Roll-a-Ball Unity tutorial. In many aspects, this tutorial continues to be a great introduction to not only Unity as a whole, but also to the scripting-side of Unity. As will be discussed in the following section, Unity is highly supportive of those who do not wish to write a single line of code. With this tutorial, however, you can get a good feel for both the non-programming side and the C# side.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To start things off, I had to decided which version of Unity I wished to use. I knew going into this project that dealing with versions would be an issue, but I had no idea just how much of an issue that would end up being. A sizeable portion of the hours spent on this project have been juggling packages and trying to learn how 2019.3 has decided to do things differently. Luckily, Roll-a-Ball is simple enough that there wasn't much difficulty here since no special packages are need. Yet another great perk of the tutorial.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My partially completed implementation of the game can be found in this project's GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/nkyllonen/8980-unity-final-project/tree/master/tutorials/Roll%20a%20Ball%20Tutorial">here</a>.

                  <div class="subheading mb-3">Shader Graph</div>
                  <p>
                    The real driving force behind deciding to use Unity for this last project was getting to play with Shader Graph. For the previous assignment, we were tasked with building and using shaders and some of my classmates decided to use Shader Graph. I was very intrigued by their descriptions of it being a means of seeing the results of your shader manipulations as you develop your shaders.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is the point at which I found the Brackeys Youtube Channel. I landed upon their <a href="https://youtu.be/Ar9eIn4z6XE">"Basics of Shader Graph - Unity Tutorial"</a> video and after watching it, began following the steps that were laid out. However, this is when I ran into my first issues with the Unity Render Pipelines. As noted in the video, to use Shader Graph, you need the Lightweight Render Pipeline installed. This turned out to be a headache, especially when I found out that in order to get bloom, I needed to set up some Post Processing items. This was very frustrating, especially since I am using the latest version of Unity 2019, which is recent enough to warrant not much relevant online help.
