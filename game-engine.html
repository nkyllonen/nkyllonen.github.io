                  In this simple game, built in Processing, the player uses moves the green slider
                  left and right to pop as many colorful balloons as possible and gain the most points.
                  One point is gained for every colorful balloon, while one point is lost for every
                  evil black balloon that is popped. This score is presented along with the current level
                  in the bottom left corner, as shown in <a href="#hw1-fig1">Figure 1</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As you gain points, you with move onto more difficult levels. Currently,
                  the levels increase one notch for every 10 points earned. Successive levels increase
                  three of the game parameters: maximum balloon spawning speed, slider speed, and the
                  chance a newly spawned balloon will be an evil balloon. Therefore for every new
                  level you face, not only are the balloons harder to pop, the slider is able to
                  travel more quickly. This is the only power-up currently implemented. These values
                  are adjusted as shown below

                  There were quite a few features I had in mind while developing this game. I added to
                  them as I went, but from the beginning, I hashed out two feature lists: basic features
                  and more farfetched features. These I placed into my Trello board, as shown in
                  <a href="#hw1-fig2">Figure 2</a> and <a href="#hw1-fig3">Figure 3</a>.

                <p>
                  The biggest feature I tried to implement for this assignment was the use of a
                  spatial data structure for collision testing (my first task within my "Next
                  Steps" features list above). Despite the goal of using such a structure being
                  to improve performance, after much thought and much work on implementing this
                  feature, I don't believe it would've actually helped improve my gameplay.
                  Although I still wish to pursue this feature, other features that are listed
                  would've more easily accomplished the task of boosting gameplay, such as
                  adding some sort of missiles or more complicated balloon movement.

                <div class="subheading mb-3">Algorithmic Discussion</div>
                <p>
                  In developing this game, I allowed my strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
                  tendencies to lead my algorithmic and technical decisions. The strongest example
                  of this is in my (ideally abstract) Object class, shown below
                  (<a href="https://github.com/nkyllonen/8980-balloon-pop/blob/master/pop/object.pde">object.pde</a>).
                  This is a stubby container class. There is no functionality and it most probably hurts
                  the overall runtime of the game. However, to myself and other OOP developers, the
                  boost of understanding and organization seems very much worth it when handling
                  the code. Understandability of the code is very much boosted by containers such as
                  Object and it's children,

                <p>
                  From a computational perspective, a bottleneck is my collision testing. Since I
                  am very much aware of the existence of this bottleneck in a majority of graphics
                  programs, I wanted to put some time into building a spatial data structure, as
                  mentioned above. My first approach, and the one which is currently still being
                  used, is a brute force approach. My game loop checks during every frame for
                  collisions between the slider and each balloon, shown in the code snippet below
                  (<a href="https://github.com/nkyllonen/8980-balloon-pop/blob/master/pop/pop.pde#L57">
                    pop.pde lines 57-70</a>).
                </p>

                <p>
                  <pre>
                    <code class="Processing" id="hw1-code3">
                        // if this balloon collides with the slider
                        if (b.checkCollision(brick)) {        
                          if (!b.evil) {
                            animations.add(new Animation(b.position.copy(), popFrames));
                            score++;
                          }
                          else {
                            animations.add(new Animation(b.position.copy(), hotFrames));
                            score--;
                          }
                  
                          balloons.remove(i);
                          continue;
                    </code>

                <p>
                  After much thought and spending a good amount of time not only considering, but
                  also attempting to integrate a spatial data structure, I decided on a gridding
                  approach which would in a sense, mark which balloons were, at least partially,
                  in which bins. After much work. I was able to accomplish this much. I created
                  a <a href="https://github.com/nkyllonen/8980-balloon-pop/blob/master/pop/grid.pde">
                    Grid</a> which knew about which balloons overlapped with which GridCells.
                    However, the more I thought about the complexity, the more I realized that
                    there would not be a performance benefit over my brute force approach. Both
                    methods required iterating over all of the balloons and for the grid approach,
                    there would be extra computation once the grid was built. Because of time
                    constraints and other responsibilities, I chose not to continue working with
                    this gridding approach.
